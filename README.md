# Trippy-frontend

This app can help you plan for trips you want to take in the future. Along with the trips you can add places you would like to explore while on the trip. Built with Ruby on Rails for the backend and React.js for the frontend.

Google calendar shows dates for easy scheduling of trips.

After you create a trip the app will send you a text confirming the trip using Twilio.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll need to have the backend code (https://github.com/brianaalexander/trippy-api.git) running on http://localhost:3000.
You can view the app on http://localhost:5173.

## Roadmap

For version 2, would like to add a place to look at and schedule flights for the trip and the ability to check the weather for the trip. Have the dates autopopulate for a new trip from selecting from the google calendar on the home page.
